# Outcome Summary:

# Data Summary:
The dataset (mtcars) was cleaned, with missing values removed and categorical variables appropriately encoded as factors.
Summary statistics revealed a diverse range of vehicle characteristics, with mpg (miles per gallon) ranging from 10.4 to 33.9.
Correlation Analysis:

Significant correlations were observed:
Negative correlation between mpg and weight (wt), displacement (disp), and horsepower (hp), suggesting heavier and more powerful cars tend to have lower fuel efficiency.
Positive correlation between mpg and variables like drat (rear axle ratio) and vs (engine shape).
Visualizations:

Scatter Plot: Showed a clear inverse relationship between wt and mpg.
Box Plot: Cars with fewer cylinders generally had higher mpg.
Histogram: Indicated a normal-like distribution of mpg.
Heatmap: Highlighted the strength and direction of variable correlations.


# Regression Models:
Linear Regression:
Achieved an Adjusted R-squared of 0.8165, indicating a good fit.
Significant predictors of mpg included wt (p â‰ˆ 0.05), showing that weight has a notable negative impact on fuel efficiency.

Logistic Regression:
Faced convergence issues, indicating potential multicollinearity or separation problems.
Despite this, the binary classification of high vs. low mpg provided insights into variable importance.
Decision Trees & Random Forest:

Decision Tree:
Identified a threshold (mpg < 20.35) that clearly segregated vehicles into high or low mpg categories.

Random Forest:
Achieved a low out-of-bag (OOB) error rate of 3.12%, indicating high classification accuracy.

Support Vector Machines (SVM):
The SVM model classified mpg with a moderate number of support vectors (18), highlighting its effectiveness in handling the dataset.

Naive Bayes:
Demonstrated distinct conditional probabilities for key predictors like wt, hp, and cyl, reinforcing their importance in distinguishing between high and low mpg.

Weight (wt) is the most influential predictor, with heavier cars consistently achieving lower mpg.
Cars with fewer cylinders are generally more fuel-efficient.
Machine learning models like Random Forest and SVM achieved high accuracy, while simpler models provided interpretable results.
